Candle

Candle is a mobile product for couples to build and maintain emotional connection through small, consistent daily interactions.

Rather than focusing on large gestures or sporadic check-ins, Candle is designed around the idea that relationships are strengthened through repetition, presence, and intentionality over time.

Problem

Most relationship tools fail for one of two reasons:

They require too much time and effort to sustain.

They turn intimacy into content, performance, or therapy.

Couples want to feel connected, but not at the cost of friction, obligation, or public exposure. The gap is not a lack of desire—it’s a lack of systems that fit naturally into everyday life.

Solution

Candle provides a lightweight daily ritual for couples.

Each day, partners are given a small, shared interaction—something that can be completed in minutes but compounds over time. These interactions are designed to encourage presence, curiosity, and emotional awareness without feeling heavy or prescriptive.

The product optimizes for:

Consistency over intensity

Private interaction over social broadcasting

Emotional alignment over productivity

Core Product Concepts
Daily Prompts

Candle surfaces short prompts and challenges intended to spark conversation or reflection. These are intentionally scoped to be:

Easy to complete

Non-judgmental

Open-ended rather than prescriptive

Prompts range from playful to reflective, with the goal of meeting couples where they are on a given day.

Shared Photo Moments

Some prompts encourage sharing a photo. These photos are private to the couple and act as lightweight documentation of shared life moments.

Over time, this creates a visual archive of the relationship that is:

Contextual

Chronological

Intentionally incomplete (no pressure to document everything)

Micro-Interactions

Candle includes small interactive gestures (e.g., “thumb kisses”) designed to provide a sense of presence and reciprocity, especially for couples who are apart.

These interactions are deliberately simple. Their value comes from frequency, not novelty.

Streaks & Rituals

Rather than gamifying the relationship, Candle tracks consistency in a subtle way.

Streaks exist to:

Reinforce habit formation

Encourage returning daily

Provide feedback without pressure

There are no leaderboards, comparisons, or public metrics.

Local Date Ideas (Beta)

Candle can surface contextual date ideas based on location. These are intended as inspiration rather than instruction.

The feature is currently in beta and evolving based on usage patterns.

Product Principles

Candle is guided by a small set of principles that inform product and engineering decisions:

Low friction
Every interaction should feel easy to start and easy to finish.

Private by default
Candle is for couples, not audiences.

Intentional scope
Features are narrow, opinionated, and focused.

Emotional safety
The product avoids judgment, scoring, or forced vulnerability.

Long-term orientation
Designed for months and years of use, not novelty spikes.
