🕯️ Candle

Candle is a mobile application that helps couples build and maintain emotional connection through small, consistent daily interactions.

The product is designed to fit naturally into everyday life. Interactions are intentionally short, private, and repeatable, with the goal of strengthening relationships over time rather than driving engagement through intensity or novelty.

🔍 Overview

Modern relationships are busy, distributed, and often mediated by technology that was not designed for intimacy. While couples want to feel emotionally connected, existing tools frequently introduce friction, pressure, or performative behavior.

Candle exists to provide a simple, reliable daily ritual for couples—one that encourages presence and communication without requiring significant time, emotional labor, or public exposure.

❗ The Problem

Most relationship products fall into one of three categories:

High-effort tools that are difficult to sustain long-term

Therapy-oriented experiences that feel heavy or prescriptive

Social products that prioritize sharing over privacy

As a result, many couples disengage even when the underlying desire to connect remains.

🧠 The Candle Approach

Candle is built around consistency rather than intensity.

Each day, couples receive a shared interaction designed to be completed in minutes. These interactions are small by design, but when repeated daily, they create momentum, awareness, and emotional alignment.

The product intentionally avoids:

Public feeds

Social comparison

Pressure-driven gamification

Over-optimization of emotional outcomes

✨ Core Features
🗓 Daily Prompts

Short prompts and challenges designed to spark conversation, reflection, or play. Prompts are intentionally open-ended and low-pressure, allowing couples to engage at their own depth.

📸 Shared Photo Moments

Some prompts invite partners to share a photo. These images are private to the couple and form a lightweight, chronological archive of shared experiences.

There is no expectation to document everything—only moments that feel meaningful in context.

🤍 Micro-Interactions

Candle includes simple interactive gestures that allow partners to express presence and affection in small ways, particularly useful for long-distance or asynchronous communication.

These interactions are designed to feel natural, not performative.

🔁 Streaks & Rituals

Candle tracks daily participation to reinforce habit formation. Streaks are subtle and supportive, not competitive.

There are no leaderboards, public metrics, or external comparisons.

📍 Local Date Ideas (Beta)

Contextual date suggestions based on location and availability. This feature is designed as inspiration rather than instruction and continues to evolve based on usage.

🎯 Product Principles

Candle is guided by the following principles:

Low friction
Interactions should be easy to start and easy to complete.

Private by default
Candle is built for couples, not audiences.

Intentional scope
Features are narrow, opinionated, and purpose-driven.

Emotional safety
The product avoids judgment, scoring, or forced vulnerability.

Long-term focus
Designed for sustained use over months and years.

🔐 Privacy & Trust

User trust is foundational to Candle.

All interactions are private by default

No public profiles or social graphs

User data is never sold or shared

Privacy is treated as a product feature, not a compliance requirement.
